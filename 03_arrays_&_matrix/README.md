# Arrays & Matrix 🔢

There are two types of arrays in programming: `1D` arrays and `2D` arrays `(Matrix)`. For any N sized array, the indexing would always starts from `0` to `N-1`. There were operation on array that includes `traversal`, `insertion`, `deletion`, `searching`, `modification`, `sorting`, and `merging`.

## Built-in methods in arrays

- `[]`: to access the array element at any index given between `[` and `]`. e.g. `arr[0]`.
- `length`: return the size of the array.
- `push(value)`: push the element at last in the array.
- `pop()`: removes & returns the element from the last in array.
- `shift()`: removes & returns the element from the first in array.
- `unshift(value)`: push the element at first in the array.
- `includes(searched-element)`: to check whether the searched-element is present in the array or not.
- `reverse()`: to reverse the array elements.

## Tricks & Tips

- To print the `n` elements cyclically without resetting the `i` of loop to 0, we should use `i % n`.

## Problems

### 🟢 `Easy`

4. Find the minimum and maximum from the array.
5. Sort the array in increasing order.
6. Sort the array in decreasing order.
7. Find the second largest element from the array.
8. Printing all the elements in a matrix.
